1. What is the core issue we're addressing as a company?
- Accessibility to mental health care is a significant challenge for many individuals.

2. How are we proposing to address this challenge?
- Our solution involves implementing a sliding scale-based access to insurance, aiming to make mental health care more accessible to a wider range of individuals.

### How do we measure our progress and effectiveness in solving this issue?

* Ensuring Progress:
Our progress will be evident through tangible improvements in users' mental health, observed during and after utilizing the app. It's essential to note that all data collected will remain internal and solely for personalized service provision. No information will be disclosed without the explicit consent of the user.

* User Feedback and Well-being Tracking:
As part of our approach, users will be prompted to share their daily mood upon logging in. This pop-up questionnaire allows users to provide brief or detailed responses regarding their emotional state. By delving deeper into their responses, we gain insights into their well-being journey. Sample questions include inquiries about positive or negative experiences throughout the day, goal achievements, and barriers hindering progress. This data enables us to tailor our services to individual needs, offering personalized support and encouragement to foster improvement.

* Effective Therapist Matching:
Effective therapist matching is pivotal to our success. Upon sign-up, users will complete a comprehensive questionnaire covering various aspects of their background, mental health history, and cultural context. This information serves as a foundation for pairing users with suitable therapists, reducing the time spent searching for an appropriate match.

* Continuous Feedback Loop:
Feedback is integral to our ongoing refinement. After each consultation, both clients and therapists will provide detailed feedback through a structured form. This process ensures the safety and effectiveness of our platform, addressing any issues promptly and enhancing user experience.

* Accessibility and Sponsorship:
Our success extends to ensuring accessibility for all, regardless of financial means. Through sponsorships and sliding-scale plans, individuals without financial stability can access our services. Monitoring the effectiveness of these initiatives allows us to adapt strategies and broaden accessibility.

* Expansion of Therapist Network:
The growth of our verified therapist network is indicative of our impact. As our platform gains traction, more therapists will join, attracted by the community ethos and opportunities to give back. We remain proactive in incentivizing participation and addressing any challenges, ensuring a sustainable model for both therapists and users alike.

### Stakeholders

The primary stakeholders involved in the data collection, analysis, and usage within the company are dedicated to upholding user privacy as a core value. All data collected will be treated with sensitivity and confidentiality, accessible only to the company's management team. Following data collection, analysis, transformation, and processing, insights will be leveraged, with continued emphasis on user privacy, to identify areas of concern and promote awareness surrounding mental health, intersectionality, and accessibility, particularly for the queer population in Germany. A key objective of analyzing this data is to ensure that the funding for our services remains accessible to everyone, aligning with our commitment to inclusivity and equity.
After the appropriate data collection, it will be analyzed and shared with the Analytics team for further processing. The results will then be provided to the developers team in concise steps, outlining necessary changes to be made to the interface based on the data collected. Continuous feedback will be provided across different teams within the company to facilitate significant adjustments in the data collection, analysis, cleaning, and visualization processes, aiming for improved results with each iteration. This iterative approach ensures that our platform evolves to better meet the needs of our users over time.

### Discovery:

**Users' Needs:** Our users are seeking assistance, a sense of community, and tangible results. They require swift and effective access to therapy for mental health improvement. The platform must offer an accessible, user-friendly interface where individuals can easily find the right therapist based on their unique needs, backgrounds, spoken languages, and other demographic factors collected.

**Data Requirements:** Data will primarily originate from users and therapists, with the database being the target repository. This data will fuel the creation of algorithms designed to provide personalized assistance to individuals based on their specific needs. It's imperative that data collection is conducted with the full consent of each user, prioritizing privacy concerns throughout the process.

**Data Quality:**  Our focus is on obtaining high-quality, personalized data directly from users, avoiding assumptions and nuances that could compromise the integrity of the information. We acknowledge the risks associated with making assumptions on behalf of the company and are committed to mitigating them by ensuring that data collection is accurate, precise, and respectful of user privacy.

The data collected through daily mood assessments and detailed feedback provides valuable insights into users' mental health progression. By tracking users' responses over time, we can quantitatively measure improvements or setbacks in their well-being. Analyzing patterns in users' experiences, accomplishments, and obstacles empowers us to provide tailored support. Additionally, statistics on successful therapist matches, user referrals, and consultation feedback serve as key indicators of platform effectiveness and user satisfaction. Monitoring metrics related to sponsorships and sliding-scale plans allows us to evaluate accessibility and efficacy in reaching economically disadvantaged individuals. Furthermore, tracking the growth of our therapist network informs strategic decisions to sustain and expand our initiatives. Ultimately, these statistics play a pivotal role in guiding decision-making and driving continuous improvement to meet the diverse needs of our users.


### Plan for Data Collection and Usage:

* **Time to Service:**

- Implement a system that timestamps user requests for mental health support and tracks the time until they receive assistance.
- Utilize a centralized database to record and analyze this data, ensuring accuracy and reliability.
- Regularly review the time-to-service metrics to identify trends, bottlenecks, and areas for improvement.
- Collaborate with the technical team to optimize platform performance and response times based on these findings.
- Conduct periodic user surveys or interviews to gather qualitative feedback on their experience with the time to service.

#### ELT Strategy for Building a Data Pipeline for Outsurance:

ELT, or Extract, Load, Transform, describes the process of integrating data by extracting it from a source, loading it into a target repository, and then transforming it for downstream use, typically in a cloud-based data warehouse.

Locate Your Data Source and Ensure Access:
Data will be sourced from the platform itself through regular questionnaires and feedback collected from users.

Integrate Your Data Sources with Your Cloud Data Warehouse:
Data integration will occur within the chosen cloud data warehouse platform, such as Snowflake or BigQuery.

Build Your Data Models to Transform Raw Source Data:
The Data Analytics team will develop data models to transform raw data into desired statistics as required.

Control Access to Your Data Models:
Access to data models will be carefully managed within the Data Analytics team to ensure privacy and protect user data.

Set Up Orchestrations for Automation:
Automation logic sequences and schedules will be established to trigger data processing automatically.

Implement Data Tests:
Data tests will be created and deployed to identify breakdowns in the data workflow, preventing failures.

Set Up Notifications:
Notifications will be configured to alert designated users of the data pipeline's progress and any issues encountered.

Deploy Data Tables for Downstream Applications:
Once the data pipeline is production-ready, data tables will be shared with downstream applications and users via reverse ETL, allowing them to build visualizations based on a single source of truth - the data pipeline.
